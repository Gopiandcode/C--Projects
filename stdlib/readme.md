# C++ standard library Experiments
Before I can fully commit to using C++ as a goto language for my projects, I'll first need to find and explore the various features offered to me by the standard library.
One of the nice things about C is that the standard library is small, which means you are not likely to end up overlapping functionality that is provided to you out of the box.
I can't really go wild with C++ projects until I really know what C++ offers out of the box.

Hence this folder.

Experiments made from notes taken while reading through a book titled "the C++ standard Library: second edition" - yes I know it targets c++11, but it's the best I have for the moment, and it should do fine.
