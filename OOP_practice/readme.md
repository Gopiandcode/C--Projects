# Object oriented programming practice in C++
I've made numerous attempts at learning the C++ syntax, and while sucessful, I've never really used it in a project, thus leading to me quickly forgetting the syntax.
To avoid this, I believe I have to learn how to approach problems in C++ - the vast number of ways of approaching problems makes it hard to know what to do - with Java I can start with a UML diagram, and then translate into code, with C I start with a struct containing all values that I'll need and then build functions around that.

This subdir will contain all the practice tasks I will do to achieve that aforementioned aim.
